## Adding new content

All you need to do is creating new markdown files.

Blogposts are defined in `blog` directory and pages are defined in `page` directory.

## Understanding the slug

The file names are the `slug` of the posts and pages. Use `file-name.md` for the default language and any other language needs to be defined in the format `name-with-dashes.lang.md`.

## Displaying the new content

Posts are added automatically to the blog list and pages need to be linked in the menu.
